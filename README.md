### Employee Check-in App
- This is a simple app that demonstrates an employee check-in.
- The user can select a date and time to submit.
- The date to be submitted must not be in the future.
- If there are no check-ins submitted before, the default date will be set to 06:30 of the current day.
- No storyboards, just programmatic UIKit and SwiftUI.
